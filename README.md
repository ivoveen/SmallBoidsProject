### Boid project

<img width="622" alt="boidsWIP" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/093cdd5f-27de-4ff7-9410-1de29deddff6" />

In this small project I played around with creating boids that show flocking behaviour.
To create this I used a paper by Craig Reynolds: https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/

I left the project untouched after adding all the rules and observing some flocking behaviours. 
However, the program has one big flaw with the movement speed of the boids. 
It currently shifts way too fast and the boids basically always go with maximum speed.
In the future I would like to come back to this project and fix it. Maybe even make a 3d version down the road.
But for now I wanted to move on to different challenges.
